# Predictive_Purchase_Order_System

Problem Overview: My aim is to optimize inventory management by predicting future pizza sales and automating ingredient orders. The project focuses on minimizing waste, preventing stockouts, and streamlining the supply chain through accurate sales forecasting and ingredient calculations.

Business Use Cases: The initiative addresses key challenges such as efficient inventory management, cost reduction through minimizing waste, accurate sales forecasting to guide promotions, and supply chain optimization by aligning orders with predicted demand.

Data Preparation: Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are essential to understanding sales patterns. This involves removing missing values, handling outliers, and visualizing trends to identify significant features for forecasting, such as seasonality, promotions, and holiday effects.

Sales Prediction Models: The project uses advanced time-series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, Regression) to forecast weekly sales. The models are evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to ensure the accuracy of predictions.

Purchase Order Generation: Once sales are forecasted, the required ingredients are calculated, leading to the creation of a purchase order. This order specifies the precise quantity of each ingredient needed to meet future demand, ensuring efficient stock management and cost savings.
